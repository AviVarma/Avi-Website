[See also ](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/):

> Hugo Pipe's PostCSS requires the `postcss-cli` JavaScript package to be installed in the environment (`npm install -g postcss postcss-cli`) along with any PostCSS plugin(s) used (e.g., `npm install -g` autoprefixer).
>
> If you are using the Hugo Snap package, PostCSS and plugin(s) need to be installed locally within your Hugo site directory, e.g., `npm install postcss-cli` without the `-g` flag.
